# Stock prediction using sentiment analysis

Python is used for the algorithm. The UI tool is buit using Java.

Basically, the algorithm uses, tweets, news feeds and past stock history to predict the price of a stock.

The data used here is Miscrosoft sock prices, its tweets and news feeds of New York Times.

Random Forest algorithm is used for stock price prediction. Smoothing algorithm is used on top of Random Forest to improve the perfomance of the algorithm.

However, currently two algorithms were created, one to predict price using new feed and past history, and another to predict from tweets and past history.

Still work is in progress to integrate all the feature into one algorithm to predict prices. This will be updated soon once completed.
